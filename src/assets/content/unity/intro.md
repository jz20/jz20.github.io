&emsp;&emsp;As someone who is interested in both making programmes and playing games, it's natural that I would want to make a videogame of my own. I made an attempt, when I was much younger and had just learned the basics of JavaScript, to make a browser platformer, but it turned out the task was too difficult for the skillset I had at the time. Since then, I haven't really attempted to make another game. 

&emsp;&emsp;My interest in game development was rekindled recently when a friend showed me some small games he made. Since some of him games are made with Unity, I explored the Unity website and realised while it seemed really powerful and daunting to get started with, there are many great resources out there to help me. Therefore, I decided to learn to use Unity and make a game of my own with it.
