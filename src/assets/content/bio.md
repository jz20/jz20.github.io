&emsp;&emsp;Hello there, I'm Jian. I am a university student in Computer Science and Maths, an aspiring software engineer, and a language enthusiast. Computing technology is fascinating to me because of the wide range of intellectual challenges it poses, and the potential it has to greatly improve our quality of life. I have some experience working on projects using what I have learned, both by myself and in groups, but I'm eager to learn more and work on more projects. The topics I'm most interested in are algorithms, software engineering, machine learning, and programming languages. Besides programming languages, I also find human languages captivating. I speak many languages to different degrees, and I'm always happy to learn more. My enthusiasm for languages also extends to some topics in linguistics.
